       "1. Syntax: Python has a simpler syntax than JavaScript, making it easier to learn and understand.\n",
       "2. Dynamically typed vs statically typed: Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare variables before using them. JavaScript, on the other hand, is statically typed, requiring explicit type declarations.\n",
       "3. Memory management: Python uses automatic memory management through garbage collection, reducing the risk of memory leaks and making it easier to write programs that handle large amounts of data. JavaScript also has automatic memory management through its garbage collector, but it's not as efficient as Python's.\n",
       "4. Cross-platform compatibility: Python can run on multiple operating systems without modification, while JavaScript is primarily associated with the web and can be more challenging to use on other platforms.\n",
       "5. Libraries and frameworks: Python has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks for various tasks, such as machine learning, data analysis, and web development. JavaScript also has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, but Python's are often considered more mature and robust.\n",
       "6. Learning curve: Many developers find Python easier to learn and use than JavaScript, especially for beginners.\n",
       "7. Job prospects: Both languages have strong job prospects, but Python is often preferred in the industry due to its versatility and wide range of applications.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ultimately, the choice between Python and JavaScript depends on your specific needs, goals, and preferences as a developer."
