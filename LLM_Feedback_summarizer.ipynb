This may indicate a design flaw or manufacturing defect that needs to be addressed. TP-Link could improve the quality control process to avoid such issues in future products.\n",
       "2. Range expansion: While the AC750 range extender effectively expanded the coverage of the WiFi network, some users reported that the signal strength decreased with distance from the main router. This suggests that the device may not provide adequate range extension, especially for larger homes or apartments. TP-Link could consider upgrading the antenna design or increasing the transmit power to improve the range of the product.\n",
       "3. Setup ease: While some users found the setup process easy with WPS, others reported difficulties in setting up the device. TP-Link could simplify the setup process by providing more detailed instructions or introducing a more user-friendly interface.\n",
       "4. Speed: One user reported that the RE450 range extender provided faster speeds than their previous RE200 model. However, some users also noted that the speed on the extension was not as fast as they expected. TP-Link could consider improving the device's hardware specifications or optimizing its software to provide better performance.\n",
       "5. Durability: There is no mention of any durability issues with the product in the reviews. However, TP-Link could consider using higher-quality materials to enhance the product's lifespan and reliability.\n",
       "6. Additional features: Some users may appreciate additional features such as a built-in switch or USB port for storing media content. TP-Link could consider adding these features to future designs to provide more value to customers.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, while the AC750 WiFi Range Extender generally receives positive reviews, there are some areas where TP-Link could improve, such as the Ethernet port issue and range expansion. By addressing these concerns, TP-Link can enhance the product's overall performance and customer satisfaction."
