Steps for Data Science projects:
- Project Documentation
	- Define the purpose and objectives of the project
- Environment Setup
	- Install necessary packages and libraries
	- Import required modules
- Data Acquisition
	- Collect data from various sources
- Data Transformation
	- Clean the data (handle missing values, outliers, etc.)
	- Manipulate and wrangle the data (merge datasets, create new columns, etc.)
- Data Preprocessing
	- Encode categorical variables
	- Handle imbalanced data, if necessary
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	- Analyze the data to understand its characteristics
	- Visualize the data
	- Document observations
- Feature Engineering
	- Select features using correlation matrix or other methods
	- Extract new features, if applicable
	- Scale features, if necessary
	- Visualize the selected features with pair plots and correlation matrix
- Data Splitting
	- Split the data into training and testing sets
	- Preprocess the training and testing data, if necessary
- Model Development
	- Select appropriate model(s)
	- Build and train the model(s)
	- Evaluate the model(s) using appropriate metrics
	- Tune hyperparameters, if necessary
	- Build the final model
- Post-modeling Analysis
	- Evaluate the final model and identify the most influential features
	- Analyze confusion matrix
	- Determine feature importances
	- Plot ROC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve, etc.
- Results Visualization
	- Create visualizations to present the results
- Conclusion
	- Summarize the findings
	- Suggest next steps or improvements
