	- Used LangChain Agents for various tasks like searching online, fetching weather, math operations, running python code, etc.
- [LLMs - Chat with Data](/projects/LLM_Chat_with_Data.ipynb)
	- Useful to chat with data to get useful insights to increase the profitability of the companies
	- Generated synthetic data using LLMs
- [LLMs - Model Deployment](/projects/LLM_Model_Deployment.ipynb)
	- Used LMDeploy and FastAPI to deploy the model by emulating OpenAI API
<!-- - [LLMs - Fine-tuning, RLHF, and RLAIF](/projects/LLM_Fine-tuning_RLHF.ipynb)
	- Used Fine-tuning, RLHF, RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback), and Responsible AI -->

Data Science projects:
- [NLP - Offensive Tweets Classification](/projects/NLP_Offensive_Tweets_Classification.ipynb)
- [ML - Loan Default Risk Prediction](/projects/ML_Loan_default_risk.ipynb)
<!-- - [Deep Learning - House price prediction](/projects/DL_House_price_prediction.ipynb) -->
<!-- - [Content recommendation for OTT platforms](/projects/Content_recommendation.ipynb) -->

#### What is special from me:
- Structured code and folders
- Common functions to reuse - [common_functions.py](/projects/common_functions.py)
- LLMs - Made the LLM calls faster and cheaper for the profitability of the companies
- Applying more concepts that are useful in the real-world projects

<!--
Next:
- MLOps, LLMOps emulation
