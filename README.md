#### What is special from me:
- Structured code and folders
- Common functions to reuse - [common_functions.py](common_functions.py)
- LLMs - Made the LLM calls faster and cheaper for the profitability of the companies


#### Upcoming
Next:
- Attempt to use RAG in Wikipedia chat
- Feedback summarizer: option to chat with feedback
- LLM - Frequent feedback for similar products (helpful to newly create a product)

	- https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#amazon_reviews
- More in GenAI & LLMs
- More in NLP
- Election result prediction project
	<!-- - fake data is generated without using personal data of users
	- use party A, B, ... instead of actual political party names
	- not specific to any state or a country -->
- MLOps, LLMOps emulation
- More projects that don't exist and are useful


<!-- on hold:

Shopping data analysis:
	- Make data realistic using Faker or other packages or searching online
	- Fix issue - no products are sold more than 0 or 1 times
	- Also displaying recommendations to the user.

	- Also custom ads that ad-providers create on my platform, predicting which ad is best suited using NLP,
		displaying both Google ads and custom ads on the platform.
		- Example: Ads by Peanut butter companies for users buying bread.
		- Use Orders data
	- Add test cases. If they don't pass, it should throw errors. -->
