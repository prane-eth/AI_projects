Why this project:
- Predict what the customer wants to buy, and recommend what else they can buy
	- For example, if a customer buys a phone, we can recommend a phone cover, screen guard, etc.
- Find list of searches that are not converted to sales
- Find the list of searches that returned no results, so we can stock-up those products
