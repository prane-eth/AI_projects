subtitle generation and dubbing project
	- reference: https://github.com/prane-eth/HindiYoutube-to-English
	tasks:
	- background noise removal is at chunk level

	- Add dubbing
	- if possible, lip syncing



Shopping data analysis:
- Create a complete data pipeline
- Make data realistic using Faker or other packages or searching online
- Fix no products are sold more than 0 or 1 times
- Add all these in documentation.
- Also displaying recommendations to the user.

- Also custom ads that ad-providers create on my platform, predicting which ad is best suited using NLP,
	displaying both Google ads and custom ads on the platform.
	- Example: Ads by Peanut butter companies for users buying bread.
	- Use Orders data
- Add test cases. If they don't pass, it should throw errors.


Next projects:
Election result prediction project
	fake data is generated without using personal data of users
	use party A, B, ... instead of actual political party names
	not specific to any state or a country
Think of more projects that don't exist
